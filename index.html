Verifiable credentials provide a mechanism to express credentials on
the Web in a way that is cryptographically secure, privacy respecting,
and machine-verifiable. This specification provides data model and
HTTP protocols to issue, verify, present, and manage data used in such an
ecosystem.

    <p>
This specification is highly experimental and changing rapidly. Implementation
in non-experimental systems is discouraged unless you are participating in
the weekly meetings that coordinate activity around this specification.

    <h2>The VC HTTP API</h2>
    <section>
      <h3>Authorization</h3>
      <p>
As an API built on top of HTTP, the VC HTTP API MAY be protected by any security technology
that is applicable to such HTTP APIs. It is RECOMMENDED that deployments use standard delegation
protocols to allow for interoperable access to the functions of the API without divulging end-user
credentials or details unnecessarily to different parties. It is NOT RECOMMENDED that deployments
use direct authentication technologies such as HTTP Basic Authentication.
      </p>
      <p>
This specification defines interoperable bindings to several standard delegation and authorization
protocols. A conformant implementation deployed with one of these technologies MUST use these
profiles and MAY further profile the connections as necessary. Each VC HTTP API endpoint defines
a an authorization <code>type</code>, <code>actions</code>, <code>datatypes</code>, and other 
security values relevant to the different actions that can be taken on an endpoint.
These security values are combined and encoded in different ways for the associated security
protocol, allowing a client to request and a policy to specify fine-grained access control
for the VC HTTP API endpoints under protection.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h4>OAuth 2.0</h4>
        <p>
When calling a VC HTTP API using OAuth 2.0, the request MUST be made using 
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-rar">OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Requests</a>
to describe the rights requested for the given API. The security parameters relevant for
the rights requested for the endpoints in question are encoded as separate objects within
the authorization details array.
        </p>
        <p>
For example, a client requesting access to the issuing endpoint hosted at
<code>https://example.com/issue</code> for the purposes of issuing credentials would
combine the security parameters defined in the issuing endpoint as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code><pre>
[
  {
    "type": "https://www.w3c.org/TR/vc-http-api",
    "actions": [ "issue" ],
    "locations": [ "https://example.com/issue" ],
    "datatypes": [ "credential" ]
  }
]
          </pre></code>
        </p>
        <p>
If this is the only request, it is encoded into the OAuth 2.0 Rich Authorization Request as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code>
authorization_details=%5B%7B%22type%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3c.org%2FTR%2Fvc-http-api%22%2C%22actions%22%3A%5B%22issue%22%5D%2C%22locations%22%3A%5B%22https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fissue%22%5D%2C%22datatypes%22%3A%5B%22credential%22%5D%7D%5D&client_id=...
          </code>
        </p>
        <p>
The OAuth 2.0 <code>scope</code> and <code>resource</code> parameters are not defined for
the VC HTTP API, though these parameters MAY be used to combine requests for other APIs with
the request for access to the VC HTTP API. Requests for different actions and endpoints MAY
be combined into the authorization details request list as different objects.
        </p>
        <p>
The access tokens granted from this process MAY be OAuth 2.0 Bearer tokens or any other
valid OAuth 2.0 token type.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol (GNAP)</h4>
        <p>
When calling a VC HTTP API using <a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-gnap-core-protocol-06.html">GNAP</a>
, the request MUST be made using the GNAP resource access rights data structures
to describe the rights requested for the given API. The security parameters relevant for
the rights requested for the endpoints in question are encoded as separate objects within
the <code>access</code> array.
        </p>
        <p>
For example, a client requesting access to the issuing endpoint hosted at
<code>https://example.com/issue</code> for the purposes of issuing credentials would
combine the security parameters defined in the issuing endpoint in the following
grant request structure:
        </p>
        <p>
          <code><pre>
{
  "access_token": {
    "access": [
      {
        "type": "https://www.w3c.org/TR/vc-http-api",
        "actions": [ "issue" ],
        "locations": [ "https://example.com/issue" ],
        "datatypes": [ "credential" ]
      }
    ]
  },
  "client": ...
}
          </pre></code>
        </p>
        <p>
This example shows a single request for a single access token, but the same structures
apply to multiple requests or multiple access tokens.
        </p>
        <p>
GNAP resource reference values are not defined for
the VC HTTP API, though such values MAY be used to combine requests for other APIs with
the request for access to the VC HTTP API. Requests for different actions and endpoints MAY
be combined into the access request list as different objects, or used in separate
access tokens.
